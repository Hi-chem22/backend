IMPORTANT NOTES
====================================

1. Consistency is crucial - make sure speaker names and room names are spelled exactly the same way throughout the document.
2. Each field (Name:, Country:, etc.) should start at the beginning of a new line.
3. Save your document as a .docx file named "congress-data.docx" in the "backend-congress/data" directory.
4. The extraction tool will generate a JSON file with the extracted data for verification before inserting into the database.
5. The tool will update existing data in the database - all current data will be deleted before new data is inserted.

For any questions or issues with data extraction, please contact the system administrator.
